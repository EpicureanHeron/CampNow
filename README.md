# Camp Now !
## You know which state you want to camp in. You know you are going to camp in the next 5 days. Let's find a camp site!

We utilize the [National Park Services API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-data-api.htm)  to surface all National Parks within a state.

From there, we allow the aspiring campter to select a national park.

Utilizing both the [Open Weather Maps API](https://openweathermap.org/api), [The Google Places Library](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places), and again [National Park Services API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-data-api.htm), we show show you the five day forecast for the park, a picture of that park, and campground information. 

Now you know what to pack and what amenities are available!
